# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project is an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data (Zip code and comments) to dynamically update the UI giving weather information.

## Instructions
The project focuses on modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file using `index.html` for element references, and `style.css` to style the application. Feel free to browse around.
